# SunCoastBricks

SunCoastBricks is a repo of various mason cli bricks that are opinionated about how Sun Coast Credit Union structures their Flutter code. 

The first brick is scuPage which provides the default code for implementing a page (or feature) in a Flutter app. This brick will generate the folder structure, view files, bloc files and 100% tests for a basic flutter page.

##Getting Started
Check out the [mason cli docs](https://pub.dev/packages/mason_cli#installation) to install mason

Once you have Mason CLI, you can create a new page in your flutter app by navigating to the /lib folder of the project and running the following command
```
mason add scuPage
mason make scuPage 'nameOfNewPage'
```
